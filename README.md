# Java Multithread App

This Java Netbeans project contain a multithread program who uses a server to broadcast messages between clients.

To test this app :

- Launch the **Server.java** in netbeans by right clicking on the file and choose "Run File"
- And Then using the same procedure, launch **Client.java**

P.S : This is a multithread client/server app. Once you start the server, you can run clients *as much you want !*
